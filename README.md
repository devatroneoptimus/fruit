 ### Since not all fruits are edible, you'd like to be able to tell whether a given fruit is edible or poisonous based on it's physical attributes
### You have some existing data that you can use for this task.
### Can you use the data to help you identify which fruit can be sold safely?

# Datasets
## I Have taken 
### Three features:-
# 1)Cap Color (Brown or Red),

# 2)Stalk Shape (Tapering  or Enlarging), and

# 3)Solitary (Yes or No)

# Label
Edible (1 indicating yes or 0 indicating poisonous)

# One hot encoded dataset
## For ease of implementation, I have one-hot encoded the features (turned them into 0 or 1 valued features)
